# Webex by Cisco Showcase

## Orientation
Hello World, welcome to a repo meant to inspire innovators to collaborate!

As of **6/10/2021** the client folder is operational, deployable, and fully documented.

The goal is to provide a template and learning resource to the Webex by Cisco community.

Give the [demo](https://github.com/BenjiFischman/WebexByCiscoDemo/blob/main/client/README.md) a try!

 H/T Cloudflare pages for hosting the demo!
